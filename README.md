# CS-GO Server Config (server.cfg)
This repo serves as a place for up and coming CS:GO server owners to quickly get a server config (server.cfg) that is not only easy to edit, but is easy to understand.

Additionally I have included commands (and mods) for each server type to get the particular server up and running. 

I have included configs for:
* Generic casual servers
* Competitive 128 tick servers
* Surf 102.4 tick servers
* Zombie Escape servers [(Download Here)](https://github.com/pedrotski/CS-GO-Zombie-Escape-Public)

ps. Right now its a work in progress!

## Why Did I Create This CFG?
During my time looking around at different configs, I had found so much misinformation regarding different rate setups and commands. Furthermore lots of configs were bloated with commands that were unnecessary. My goal with this repo is for it to be a trusted source where new server owners can quickly grab a config and they can trust it will perform well.

It's also in my best interest to make sure people are educated about the commands that they are running on their server.
